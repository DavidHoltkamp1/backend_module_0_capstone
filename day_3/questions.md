## Day 3 Questions

1. What is a conditional statement? Give three examples.

-- Conditional statements evaluate a true or false, and does different things depending on the outcome.

-- To make a pizza, we need cheese and sauce. If those conditions are not met, we cannot make the pizza

--To take a bath, we must fill up the tub. If that condition isn't met, a shower it is.

-- To drink coffee, I must grind the beans and start the coffee pot. If those don't happen, if they are false, no coffee.
